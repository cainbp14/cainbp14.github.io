<p>"We" are just one guy doing a project for his class. <em>I</em> compared part of my site to Dealsea. You can see that the menu is similar,<br/>
but I thought that a centered menu would look better and easier to immediately notice. I also figured that a JavaScript based store would look more appealing.<br/>
I have an onclick event for each of the banners(Catbug banner and Ironman banner), which changes which shirts your seeing, the description of them, and the links they go to.<br/>
There is also an onhover event on each banner that gives it a light blue border. I used HTML5 elements(section) in the shop page to separate the banners and the T-Shirts betweem each other.<br/>
I used a table on the Jobs page to evenly separate the forum.</p>
